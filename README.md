## 📖 Description
This project is an interactive dashboard that explains how API requests flow in a modern web application. It visually breaks down each step, from the client browser to backend API routes, server logic, database interaction, and the response sent back to the client. Users can click through different stages to dynamically view explanations and visuals. Built with React and Redux Toolkit for state management, and styled using Tailwind CSS with a modern dark theme, this project is ideal for learning, teaching core web concepts, and showcasing frontend architecture skills.
